## Week 3 Notes

* 2018/01/31 Online Zoom class meeting.
* 2018/02/01 Added functionality to REST service.
* 2018/03/01 Did not do much today.  Just renamed my first rest project as per request by instructor.  Also, I forgot to call my Mom.  But, I will call her tomorrow.

## Week 4 Notes
* 2018/02/04 Re-wrote base rest app/api to have a more efficient "performance" end-point.  
* 2018/02/04 Drank beer and had chips before Super Bowl LII.  
* 2018/02/05 Started work on swagger project.  Created docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, and Dockerfile.mongodb as part of project's development environment.  
* 2018/02/06 More work on swagger project.  Continued docker setup this mornging.  
* 2018/02/09 I was planning on doing substantially more work on this project on this day, but glitches in another class distracted me away from dedicating more work to here.

## Week 5 Notes
* 2018/02/12 Over the previous weekend I decided to do some slight restructuring of the project.  I am building the backend and a good portion of the frontend using Django and the [Django web development](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, the [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) plugin, and the [Django Swagger UI](https://marcgibbons.com/django-rest-swagger/) plugin to develop the project.  Django and the plugins are excellent for this kind of project and my thinking is why reinvent the wheel.  
* 2018/02/14 Developed the Swagger UI for the application and started working on the client part of the application.  The client side is a Vue.js based web interface.  
* 2018/01/14 Created an empy technology folder that will be used to hold abstracts from the technologies list.  
* 2018/02/15 Started developing abstracts in the technology folder.
