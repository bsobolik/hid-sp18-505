Netflix
Netflix offers a big-data platform that has both data and services that can be used to access data as well as processing tools (algorithms) that can be used to analyze data.  For example, Netflix’s platform has tools that can be used to detect outliers in large data sets  \cite{NetFlixOutLiers}.  Netflix’s data sets can be consumed and analyzed with their platform analytical tools or the tools can be used independently on other non-Netflix data sets \cite{Netflix}.
